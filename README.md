Segmentation is the practice of dividing a database into groups of observations that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing. Each groups contain individuals that are similar in-between themselves, and different from individuals from the other groups. Segmentation is widely used as a marketing tool to create clusters of clients and adapt a relevant strategy for each of them.

In this notebook, we will be illustrating how to apply K Means algorithm to a dataset. Here we have a dataset of customers who purchase stuff in a mall. This dataset contains information such as Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score.

First, we will perform exploratory data analysis and then work on customer segmentation by implementing K-Means Clustering based on the characteristics of customers. In this way, we can find the main clusters which are the most representative types of customers.
